# JAVA
Linear Algebra functions, as well as scripts from my class.

## Linear_Algebra:
**EigenValues.java:** Finds all the eigenvalues of a matrix within certain constraints. The *constraints* are as follows:
1. Cannot compute complex or imaginary eigenvalues
2. The minimum and maximum eigenvalues in absolute value cannot have positive or negative counterpart.
3. Any eigenvalues cannot be within 1e-4 of eachother in value.

**rref.java:** Uses Gaussian Elimination to return a matrix in reduced row echelon form.

**linsolve.java:** Utilizes Gaussian Elimination, the inverse, and matrix multiplication to return the coefficients for a systems of a equations.

## Intro_To_Programming
**FinalTax.java:** Calculates how much of a clients income will be taxed, based on their filing status. Returns their tax bracket, ID, and tax.

**LastChance.java:** Let the fun begin! This is a game involving rolling the given number of dice combinations on a card, in a certain amount of allotted turns. The catch it, you can either bet for yourself, or against yourself! Read the instructions at the top of the file for the full set of rules!

**Rocket_Valentino.java:** Simulates a rocket trying to escape the earths atmosphere. Updated values using Eulers Method.

**Subtract_Quiz.java:** Runs a quiz that asks the user simple interger subtraction.
